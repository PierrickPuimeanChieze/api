Authentication
=====

We use OAuth 2 to authenticate API requests.

You will need a Shoeboxed account to provision your OAuth 2 credentials. If you are not a Shoeboxed user, sign up for a "DIY" account which is 100% free.  [Cick here to register for Shoeboxed](https://register.shoeboxed.com/) *A paid Shoeboxed account is __not__ required so you may click the skip button when you see the pricing table!*


API Endpoints
=====

Our [Swagger](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) documentation is the most complete description of all endpoints and parameters. If you plug in your OAuth credentials, you may make test calls to the API without leaving your browser.

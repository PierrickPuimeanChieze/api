API Terms of Service

Thank you for using the Shoeboxed API!

We have developed the Shoeboxed API to provide a way for external applications to access Shoeboxed data on behalf of Shoeboxed users. Please read the full terms of service below, as they govern your use of Shoeboxed API.

By using the Shoeboxed API (the “Service”), you (“You”) accept and agree to be bound by the Shoeboxed Terms of Service as well as these additional terms and conditions (the “Terms of Service”). It is important for You to read each of these two documents, as they form a legal agreement between You and Shoeboxed Inc. regarding your use of the Service.

1. Service.

1.1 Description of Service. The API allows You to display certain content, including receipt and business card images and metadata on your website, subject to the limitations and conditions described below. The information accessible through the Service, not limited to receipt information, Shoeboxed user information, and receipt imagery, is referred to in this document as “the Content.”

Subject to the limitations and conditions described in the terms of service, You may use the API to display the Content in conjunction with other information You provide to end users. You may not access, reproduce, or use the Content for any other purpose.

The API may be used for services that are accessible to business and consumers with or without charge.

There is no fee to use the Shoeboxed API. We reserve the right to charge a fee for using the Shoeboxed API and/or any individual features thereof at any time in our sole discretion. If we do charge a fee for using Shoeboxed API or any feature thereof you do not have any obligation to continue to use Shoeboxed API or the applicable feature.

In order to obtain access to the API, You must have a Shoeboxed Account. After supplying Shoeboxed with Your account information, the URL of your service, and agreeing to the Terms of Service, You will be issued an alphanumeric key assigned to You by Shoeboxed that is uniquely associated with your Shoeboxed Account and the URL of your service. Your service must identify itself as described in the Shoeboxed API Documentation with this key. Shoeboxed will block requests with an invalid key or invalid URL. Shoeboxed shall have sole and complete control over the data and data format returned through the API. You may not obtain more than one key for use in the Service.

1.2 Content in the Service. Content in the Service includes receipt and business card information, user information, and receipt and business card images. Your use of this Content is limited to displaying it to end users within the Service itself, and in the same manner, form, format, and appearance as it is provided by the Service. You may not, nor may you allow others to, copy, distribute, display, alter, or otherwise use the Content except as it is provided to you through the Service.
Shoeboxed reserves the sole right and discretion to determine whether your display of the Content through the Service is in conformance with this Section, and also reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Content at any time for any reason, without notice.

1.3 Modifications. Shoeboxed reserves the right to release subsequent versions of the API and to require You to obtain and use the most recent version. Shoeboxed may modify the Terms of Service at any time with or without notice, and You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service online at any time at https://www.shoeboxed.com/api/terms/. If a modification is unacceptable to You, You may cancel the Service by removing the API code from Your Site. If You continue to use the Service, You will be deemed to have accepted the modifications.

1.4 Appropriate Conduct and Prohibited Uses. The Service may be used for services that are accessible to consumers or businesses with or without charge.

You agree that You are responsible for your own conduct and content while using the Service and for any consequences thereof. You agree to use the Service only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these Terms of Service and any applicable policies or guidelines.

Such notice may be provided on relevant Shoeboxed websites, including but not limited to the Shoeboxed Blog and may be emailed to all API users. During that 30 day period, you may terminate your use of the Service, or provide notice of your refusal to accept advertising in accordance with Shoeboxed’s policies and procedures for providing such notice (which Shoeboxed may make available from time to time in its sole discretion).

1.6 API Requests. You may make up to 50,000 API requests (calls) in a 24 hour period. If you exceed this value within a 24-hour limit, the Shoeboxed API may stop working for you temporarily. If you attempt to circumvent this limit, your access to the Service may be blocked immediately. You may request additional API requests by writing help@team.shoeboxed.com but we cannot guarantee your request will be honored.

Shoeboxed API Authentication
===

All API requests must be authenticated by passing along an OAuth 2.0 token.

By default, Shoeboxed supports the "code grant" which is the standard grant type for apps with a server-side component like web apps. If needed, we can manually enable the "implicit grant" flow for you if you are creating a client-side app such as a mobile app or JS app. Drop us a line at api@team.shoeboxed.com

## Using the code grant

### Step 1: Begin authorization

Direct the user to the OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint:

    https://api.shoeboxed.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=<your client id>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=<your site>&state=<CSRF token>
    
We strongly recommend you use the state parameter to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF). You should generate a random CSRF token, store a copy in user's session, then verify it (see below) to prevent forgery.

Once the user has authorized your app, theyâ€™ll be sent to your redirect URI, with a few query parameters:

    https://www.yoursite.com/page?code=<authorization code>&state=<CSRF token>

Your app should verify the CSRF token matches the one you previously generated and stored, and then pull out the authorization code which you'll need in the next step.


### Step 2: Obtain an access token

To exchange the authorization code for an access token, you need to do a server-side POST to the /token endpoint:

    curl https://api.shoeboxed.com/login/oauth/token -X POST -d code=<authorization code> -d grant_type=authorization_code -u <your client id>:<your client secret>

The response will look like:
````
{
  "access_token": "1cb04374-da51-4394-adaf-ae7d4ee05571",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 21115, // in seconds
  "scope": "all"
}
````

### Step 3: Call the API

Now that you have an access token, you can call any method in the v2 API by just attaching the following header:

    Authorization: Bearer <access token>

As an example, here's how to use curl to get information about the user:

    curl https://api.shoeboxed.com/v2/user -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer <user access token>'
